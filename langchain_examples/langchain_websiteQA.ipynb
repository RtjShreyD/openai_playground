It's not as easy as it sounds to find the right one for you, so we've put together this guide to help you make an informed decision.\\nFirst off, let's talk about the basics and understand credit cards.\\nThey're basically plastic cards that allow you to borrow money from your bank and pay it back over time. Some people use them for convenience—they can use them like cash at any time, and they don't have to worry about paying interest on their purchases. Others prefer them because they offer more flexibility in terms of spending limits and fees than debit cards do.\\nWhich are the best credit cards to keep in India? Many people, especially the salaried ones ask this question. The truth is, there is no single credit card that is best suited to everybody. Every credit card is different and offers different kinds of benefits.\\n10 Top Credit Cards in India\\nCategories\\nCredit Card\\nBest Credit Cards for Salaried Individuals\\n1. Standard Chartered Platinum Rewards Card\\n2. Axis Bank Insta Credit Card\\n3. Citibank Cashback Credit Card\\nBest Credit Cards for Students\\n1. ICICI Instant Platinum Card\\n2. SBI Student Plus Advantage Card\\nBest Credit Cards for Shopping and Online Purchases\\n1. Standard Chartered Manhattan Credit Card\\n2. SBI Simply Click Credit Card\\n3. Citibank Cashback Credit Card\\nBest Credit Cards to Travel\\n1. Indian Oil Titanium Citibank Credit Card\\n2. HDFC Platinum Plus Credit Card\\nFactors To Consider Before Opting For A Credit Card\\nWhen you're ready to apply for the best credit card in India, there are a few factors that you'll want to take into consideration:\\nCredit Score\\nFirst, the credit score requirements will vary depending on the type of card you're looking for. If you're looking for a card specifically for travel and shopping, the higher, the better—but if you don't have much of a history of using credit cards, it might be wise to start with the one that's easier to qualify for.\\nFees\\nSecond, fees can quickly add up—especially if you tend to carry a balance from month to month (which is common with cards like this). A high-interest rate can also make it more difficult to pay off your balance each month, so be sure to shop around when comparing rates. Be sure to check the fees associated with your chosen card.\\nSome cards offer cash-back rewards or other perks that come with annual fees or interest rates. Others charge an annual fee even if there are no other fees or interest rates attached to the account itself. You'll need to figure out what works best for you before signing up!\\nInterest Rates\\nThird, interest rates are typically higher, so make sure that's an important factor when choosing your card. The interest rate you'll pay on your new credit card will depend on how long you've been using it and where you live.\\nMost cards offer an introductory period where there are no fees or interest charges for your first few months of use, but then this changes into a regular APR (annual percentage rate). These rates vary from 0% up to 27% depending on how long you've had the account and where you live.\\nYou may also want to read 13 Things You Need to Know About Credit Cards\\nFeatures To Watch Out Before Applying For The Best Credit Card in India\\nWhen applying for a credit card in India, it's a good idea to do some research on the offers and features offered by your potential credit card provider as per your use. These can be very useful in helping you to manage your finances.\\n1) How You Plan to Use the Card\\nBefore applying for a credit card in India, you should first consider how you plan to use it. A credit card is a great way to build your credit history and establish yourself as an income earner. You can use a credit card for any purpose, but you should be aware of its limits before applying.\\n2) Annual Percentage Rates (APRs)\\nAnother important factor is annual percentage rates (APRs). These are the interest rates charged by banks and other financial institutions on loans or credit cards.\\nThe rate will vary depending on many factors, including how much money you want to borrow, how long it will take for you to repay this amount, and how reliable your income is at any given time (for example, if there are other expenses such as rent or student loans that need paying every month).\\n3) Credit Limit\\nIf you don't plan on using the money on the card regularly, then there's no need to worry about having a high credit limit.\\nBut if you do plan on making regular purchases with it, then your credit limit must be large enough to accommodate these purchases without jeopardizing your ability to pay off the balance in full each month.\\n4) Rewards\\nWhen considering rewards programs, make sure they're worth the cost. Some cards offer cash back or other perks, but thos\""
